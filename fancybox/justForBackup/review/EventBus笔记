ThreadMode: POSTING Subscribers will be called in the same thread posting the event. This is the default.

ThreadMode: MAIN Subscribers will be called in Androidâ€™s main thread (sometimes referred to as UI thread).

ThreadMode: BACKGROUND Subscribers will be called in a background thread. If posting thread is not the main thread, event handler methods will be called directly in the posting thread. If the posting thread is the main thread, EventBus uses a single background thread that will deliver all its events sequentially. 

ThreadMode: ASYNC Event handler methods are called in a separate thread. This is always independent from the posting thread and the main thread. Posting events never wait for event handler methods using this mode. Event handler methods should use this mode if their execution might take some time, e.g. for network access. Avoid triggering a large number of long running asynchronous handler methods at the same time to limit the number of concurrent threads. EventBus uses a thread pool to efficiently reuse threads from completed asynchronous event handler notifications.
